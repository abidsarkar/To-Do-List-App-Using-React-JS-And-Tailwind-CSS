*   Customize Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js` (if needed).
*   Create a `.env` file for environment variables (if applicable).
*   Refer to the `package.json` file for custom scripts.

This version is more concise and better suited for a README.md file. You can further enhance it by:

*   Adding screenshots of the project.
*   Providing a brief project description.
*   Including a section on contributing to the project.
*   Adding a section on troubleshooting common issues.

I hope this helps!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
